### Scikit-LLM: Supercharge Text Analysis with ChatGPT and scikit-learn Integration 

```{python tags=c("hide-cell")}
# !pip install scikit-llm
```

To integrate advanced language models with scikit-learn for enhanced text analysis tasks, use Scikit-LLM.

Scikit-LLM's `ZeroShotGPTClassifier` enables text classification on unseen classes without requiring re-training. 

```{python}
from skllm.config import SKLLMConfig

SKLLMConfig.set_openai_key("<YOUR_KEY>")
SKLLMConfig.set_openai_org("<YOUR_ORGANISATION>")
```

```{python}
from skllm.datasets import get_classification_dataset
from skllm import ZeroShotGPTClassifier

# demo sentiment analysis dataset
# labels: positive, negative, neutral
X, y = get_classification_dataset()

clf = ZeroShotGPTClassifier(openai_model="gpt-3.5-turbo")
clf.fit(X, y)
labels = clf.predict(X)
```

```{python}
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y, labels):.2f}")
```

### Create a Readable Machine Learning Pipeline in One Line of Code


If you want to create a readable machine learning pipeline in a single line of code, try the `make_pipeline` function in scikit-learn.
`make_pipeline` is especially useful when working with complex pipelines that involve many different transformers and estimators.

```{python}
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

X, y = make_classification(random_state=42)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, random_state=42)

# Create a pipeline that scales the data and fits a logistic regression model
pipeline = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), LogisticRegression())

# Fit the pipeline to the training data
pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the pipeline on the test data
pipeline.score(X_test, y_test)

```

### Pipeline + GridSearchCV: Prevent Data Leakage when Scaling the Data


Scaling the data before using GridSearchCV can lead to data leakage since the scaling tells some information about the entire data. To prevent this, assemble both the scaler and machine learning models in a pipeline then use it as the estimator for GridSearchCV. 

```{python}
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, GridSearchCV
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris

# load data
df = load_iris()
X = df.data
y = df.target

# split data into train and test
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, random_state=0)

# Create a pipeline variable
make_pipe = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), SVC())

# Defining parameters grid
grid_params = {"svc__C": [0.1, 1, 10, 100, 1000], "svc__gamma": [0.1, 1, 10, 100]}

# hypertuning
grid = GridSearchCV(make_pipe, grid_params, cv=5)
grid.fit(X_train, y_train)

# predict
y_pred = grid.predict(X_test)
```

The estimator is now the entire pipeline instead of just the machine learning model.


### squared=False: Get RMSE from Sklearnâ€™s mean_squared_error method


To obtain the root mean squared error (RMSE) using scikit-learn, use the `squared=False` parameter in the `mean_squared_error` method.

```{python}
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

y_actual = [1, 2, 3]
y_predicted = [1.5, 2.5, 3.5]
rmse = mean_squared_error(y_actual, y_predicted, squared=False)
rmse
```

### modelkit: Build Production ML Systems in Python
<!-- #endregion -->

```{python tags=c("hide-cell")}
# !pip install modelkit textblob 
```

If you want your ML models to be fast, type-safe, testable, and fast to deploy to production, try modelkit. modelkit allows you to incorporate all of these features into your model in several lines of code. 

```{python}
from modelkit import ModelLibrary, Model 
from textblob import TextBlob, WordList
# import nltk
# nltk.download('brown')
# nltk.download('punkt')
```

To define a modelkit Model, you need to:

- create class inheriting from `modelkit.Model`
- implement a `_predict` method

```{python}
class NounPhraseExtractor(Model):

    # Give model a name
    CONFIGURATIONS = {"noun_phrase_extractor": {}}

    def _predict(self, text):
        blob = TextBlob(text)
        return blob.noun_phrases
```

You can now instantiate and use the model:

```{python}
noun_extractor = NounPhraseExtractor()
noun_extractor("What are your learning strategies?")
```

You can also create test cases for your model and make sure all test cases are passed. 

```{python}
class NounPhraseExtractor(Model):

    # Give model a name
    CONFIGURATIONS = {"noun_phrase_extractor": {}}

    TEST_CASES = [
        {"item": "There is a red apple on the tree", "result": WordList(["red apple"])}
    ]

    def _predict(self, text):
        blob = TextBlob(text)
        return blob.noun_phrases
```

```{python}
noun_extractor = NounPhraseExtractor()
noun_extractor.test()
```

modelkit also allows you to organize a group of models using `ModelLibrary`.

```{python}
class SentimentAnalyzer(Model):
    
    # Give model a name
    CONFIGURATIONS = {"sentiment_analyzer": {}}

    def _predict(self, text):
        blob = TextBlob(text)
        return blob.sentiment
```

```{python}
nlp_models = ModelLibrary(models=[NounPhraseExtractor, SentimentAnalyzer])
```

Get and use the models from `nlp_models`.

```{python}
noun_extractor = model_collections.get("noun_phrase_extractor")
noun_extractor("What are your learning strategies?")
```

```{python}
sentiment_analyzer = model_collections.get("sentiment_analyzer")
sentiment_analyzer("Today is a beautiful day!")
```

### Decomposing High-Dimensional Data into Two or Three Dimensions

```{python tags=c("hide-cell")}
# !pip install yellowbrick
```

If you want to decompose high dimensional data into two or three dimensions to visualize it, what should you do? A common technique is PCA. Even though PCA is useful, it can be complicated to create a PCA plot.

Lucikily, Yellowbrick allows you visualize PCA in a few lines of code

```{python}
from yellowbrick.datasets import load_credit
from yellowbrick.features import PCA
```

```{python}
X, y = load_credit()
classes = ["account in defaut", "current with bills"]
```

```{python}
visualizer = PCA(scale=True, classes=classes)
visualizer.fit_transform(X, y)
visualizer.show()
```

### Visualize Feature Importances with Yellowbrick

```{python tags=c("hide-cell")}
# !pip install yellowbrick
```

More features don't always mean a better model. Too many features can lead to overfitting. To improve your model, you might need to identify and eliminate less important features. Yellowbrick's `FeatureImportances` can help with this.

```{python}
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from yellowbrick.datasets import load_occupancy
from yellowbrick.model_selection import FeatureImportances
```

```{python}
X, y = load_occupancy()

model = DecisionTreeClassifier()

viz = FeatureImportances(model)
viz.fit(X, y)
viz.show();
```

From the plot above, it seems like the light is the most important feature to DecisionTreeClassifier, followed by CO2, temperature.

### Validation Curve: Determine if an Estimator Is Underfitting Over Overfitting

```{python tags=c("hide-cell")}
# !pip install yellowbrick
```

To determine if your model is overfitting or underfitting, use Yellowbrick's validation curve. This technique helps find the optimal hyperparameter value where the model performs well on both training and validation sets.

```{python}
from yellowbrick.datasets.loaders import load_occupancy
from yellowbrick.model_selection import validation_curve
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

import numpy as np 
```

```{python}
# Load data
X, y = load_occupancy()
```

In the code below, we choose the range of `max_depth` to be from 1 to 11.

```{python}
viz = validation_curve(
    DecisionTreeClassifier(), X, y, param_name="max_depth",
    param_range=np.arange(1, 11), cv=10, scoring="f1",
)
```

As we can see from the plot above, although `max_depth` > 2 has a higher training score but a lower cross-validation score. This indicates that the model is overfitting. 

Thus, the sweet spot will be where the cross-validation score neither increases nor decreases, which is 2.

### Mlxtend: Plot Decision Regions of Your ML Classifiers

```{python tags=c("hide-cell")}
# !pip install mlxtend  
```

To understand how your classifier makes decisions, plotting decision regions can be insightful. Mlxtend's `plot_decision_regions` function makes this easy.

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.gridspec as gridspec
import itertools
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from mlxtend.classifier import EnsembleVoteClassifier
from mlxtend.data import iris_data
from mlxtend.plotting import plot_decision_regions

# Initializing Classifiers
clf1 = LogisticRegression(random_state=0)
clf2 = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=0)
clf3 = SVC(random_state=0, probability=True)
eclf = EnsembleVoteClassifier(clfs=[clf1, clf2, clf3], weights=[2, 1, 1], voting='soft')

# Loading some example data
X, y = iris_data()
X = X[:,[0, 2]]

# Plotting Decision Regions
gs = gridspec.GridSpec(2, 2)
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))

for clf, lab, grd in zip([clf1, clf2, clf3, eclf],
                         ['Logistic Regression', 'Random Forest', 'RBF kernel SVM', 'Ensemble'],
                         itertools.product([0, 1], repeat=2)):
    clf.fit(X, y)
    ax = plt.subplot(gs[grd[0], grd[1]])
    fig = plot_decision_regions(X=X, y=y, clf=clf, legend=2)
    plt.title(lab)
plt.show()
```

### imbalanced-learn: Deal with an Imbalanced Dataset

```{python tags=c("hide-cell")}
# !pip install imbalanced-learn==0.10.0 mlxtend==0.21.0 scikit-learn==1.2.2
```

In machine learning, imbalanced datasets can lead to biased models that perform poorly on minority classes. This is particularly problematic in critical applications like fraud detection or disease diagnosis.

With imbalanced-learn, you can rebalance your dataset using various sampling techniques that work seamlessly with scikit-learn.

To demonstrate this, let's generate a sample dataset with 5000 samples, 2 features, and 4 classes:

```{python editable=TRUE, slideshow={'slide_type': ''}, tags=c("remove-cell")}
import warnings

warnings.simplefilter("ignore", UserWarning)
```

```{python}
# Libraries for plotting
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mlxtend.plotting import plot_decision_regions

# Libraries for machine learning
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.svm import LinearSVC
from imblearn.over_sampling import RandomOverSampler
```

```{python}
X, y = make_classification(
    n_samples=5000,
    n_features=2,
    n_informative=2,
    n_redundant=0,
    n_repeated=0,
    n_classes=4,
    n_clusters_per_class=1,
    weights=[0.01, 0.04, 0.5, 0.90],
    class_sep=0.8,
    random_state=0,
)
```

Resample the dataset using the `RandomOverSampler` class from imbalanced-learn to balance the class distribution. This technique works by duplicating minority samples until they match the majority class.

```{python}
ros = RandomOverSampler(random_state=1)
X_resampled, y_resampled = ros.fit_resample(X, y)
```

Plot the decision regions of the dataset before and after resampling using a LinearSVC classifier:

```{python}
# Plotting Decision Regions
fig, (ax0, ax1) = plt.subplots(nrows=2, ncols=1, sharey=True, figsize=(6, 10))

for Xi, yi, ax, title in zip(
    [X, X_resampled],
    [y, y_resampled],
    [ax0, ax1],
    ["Without resampling", "Using RandomOverSampler"],
):
    clf = LinearSVC()
    clf.fit(Xi, yi)
    fig = plot_decision_regions(X=Xi, y=yi, clf=clf, legend=2, ax=ax, colors='#E583B6,#72FCDB,#72BEFA,#FFFF99')
    plt.title(title)
    ax.set_title(title, color='#000000')
```

The plot reveals that the resampling process has added more data points to the minority class (green), effectively balancing the class distribution.

### Estimate Prediction Intervals in Scikit-Learn Models with MAPIE 

```{python tags=c("hide-cell")}
# !pip install mapie
```

To estimate prediction intervals for scikit-learn models, use the MAPIE library:


In the code below, we use `MapieRegressor` to estimate prediction intervals for a scikit-learn regressor. 

```{python}
from mapie.regression import MapieRegressor
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.datasets import make_regression

# Create data
X, y = make_regression(n_samples=200, n_features=1, noise=50, random_state=0)

# Train and predict
alpha = [0.05, 0.32]
mapie = MapieRegressor(LinearRegression())
mapie.fit(X, y)
y_pred, y_pis = mapie.predict(X, alpha=alpha)

```

```{python}
# compute the coverage of the prediction intervals
from mapie.metrics import regression_coverage_score

coverage_scores = [
    regression_coverage_score(y, y_pis[:, 0, i], y_pis[:, 1, i])
    for i, _ in enumerate(alpha)
]

```

```{python}
# Plot the estimated prediction intervals

from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

plt.figure(figsize=(11, 7))
plt.xlabel("x", fontsize=20)
plt.ylabel("y", fontsize=20)
plt.xticks(fontsize=20) 
plt.yticks(fontsize=20) 
plt.scatter(X, y, alpha=0.3, c='#06B1CF', s=80)
plt.plot(X, y_pred, color="#E48789", linewidth=3)
order = np.argsort(X[:, 0])
plt.plot(X[order], y_pis[order][:, 0, 1], color="#E48789", ls="--", linewidth=3)
plt.plot(X[order], y_pis[order][:, 1, 1], color="#E48789", ls="--", linewidth=3)
plt.fill_between(
    X[order].ravel(),
    y_pis[order][:, 0, 0].ravel(),
    y_pis[order][:, 1, 0].ravel(),
    alpha=0.2,
    color="#E48789"
)
plt.title(
    f"Target coverages for "
    f"alpha={alpha[0]:.2f}: ({1-alpha[0]:.3f}, {coverage_scores[0]:.3f})\n"
    f"Target coverages for "
    f"alpha={alpha[1]:.2f}: ({1-alpha[1]:.3f}, {coverage_scores[1]:.3f})",
    fontsize=20,
)
plt.show()

```

### MLEM: Capture Your Machine Learning Model's Metadata

```{python tags=c("hide-cell")}
# !pip install mlem 
```

The metadata of a machine learning model provides important information about the model such as:

- Hash value
- Model methods
- Input data schema
- Python requirements used to train the model. 

This information enables others to reproduce the model and its results. 

With MLEM, you can save both the model and its metadata in a single line of code.

```{python}
from sklearn import datasets
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Load the diabetes dataset
diabetes = datasets.load_diabetes()

# Split the dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(diabetes.data, diabetes.target, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

# Create a linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()

# Train the model on the training set
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

```{python}
from mlem.api import save 

# Instead of joblib.dump(model, 'model/diabetes_model')
save(model, 'model/diabetes_model', sample_data=X_test)
```

Running the code above will create two files: a model file and a metadata file.


```bash
model
 â”œâ”€â”€  diabetes_model  
 â””â”€â”€  diabetes_model.mlem  
```


Here is what the metadata file looks like:


```yaml
# model/diabetes_model.mlem

### Distributed Machine Learning with MLlib

```{python tags=c("hide-cell")}
# !pip install pyspark
```

If you want to perform distributed machine learning tasks and handle large-scale datasets, use MLlib. It's designed to work seamlessly with Apache Spark, making it a powerful tool for scalable machine learning.

Similar to scikit-learn, MLlib provides the following tools:
- ML Algorithms: Classification, regression, clustering, and collaborative filtering
- Featurization: Feature extraction, transformation, dimensionality reduction, and selection
- Pipelines: Construction, evaluation, and tuning of ML Pipelines

```{python}
from pyspark.ml.linalg import Vectors
from pyspark.ml.classification import LogisticRegression
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

spark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()

# Prepare training data from a list of (label, features) tuples.
training = spark.createDataFrame(
    [
        (1.0, Vectors.dense([0.0, 1.1, 0.1])),
        (0.0, Vectors.dense([2.0, 1.0, -1.0])),
        (0.0, Vectors.dense([2.0, 1.3, 1.0])),
        (1.0, Vectors.dense([0.0, 1.2, -0.5])),
    ],
    ["label", "features"],
)

# Prepare test data
test = spark.createDataFrame(
    [
        (1.0, Vectors.dense([-1.0, 1.5, 1.3])),
        (0.0, Vectors.dense([3.0, 2.0, -0.1])),
        (1.0, Vectors.dense([0.0, 2.2, -1.5])),
    ],
    ["label", "features"],
)

# Create a LogisticRegression instance. This instance is an Estimator.
lr = LogisticRegression(maxIter=10, regParam=0.01)

# Learn a LogisticRegression model. This uses the parameters stored in lr.
model1 = lr.fit(training)

# Make predictions on test data using the Transformer.transform() method.
# LogisticRegression.transform will only use the 'features' column.
prediction = model1.transform(test)
result = prediction.select("features", "label", "probability", "prediction").collect()

for row in result:
    print(
        "features=%s, label=%s -> prob=%s, prediction=%s"
        % (row.features, row.label, row.probability, row.prediction)
    )

```

### Rapid Prototyping and Comparison of Basic Models with Lazy Predict


Lazy Predict enables rapid prototyping and comparison of multiple basic models without extensive manual coding or parameter tuning. 

This helps data scientists identify promising approaches and iterate on them more quickly.


```python
from lazypredict.Supervised import LazyClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

data = load_breast_cancer()
X = data.data
y= data.target

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y,test_size=.5,random_state =123)

clf = LazyClassifier(verbose=0, ignore_warnings=True, custom_metric=None)
models, predictions = clf.fit(X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test)

print(models)
```
```bash

### AutoGluon: Fast and Accurate ML in 3 Lines of Code


The traditional scikit-learn approach requires extensive manual work, including data preprocessing, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning.


```python
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder, StandardScaler
from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

# Preprocessing Pipeline
numeric_transformer = SimpleImputer(strategy='mean')
categorical_transformer = OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore')

preprocessor = ColumnTransformer(
    transformers=[
        ('num', numeric_transformer, numerical_columns),
        ('cat', categorical_transformer, categorical_columns)
    ])

# Machine Learning Pipeline
model = RandomForestClassifier()

pipeline = Pipeline(steps=[
    ('preprocessor', preprocessor),
    ('scaler', StandardScaler()),
    ('model', model)
])

# Hyperparameter Tuning
param_grid = {
    'model__n_estimators': [100, 200, 300],
    'model__max_depth': [5, 10, None],
    'model__min_samples_split': [2, 5, 10]
}

grid_search = GridSearchCV(pipeline, param_grid, cv=5, scoring='accuracy')
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)
grid_search.predict(X_test)
```


In contrast, AutoGluon automates these tasks, allowing you to train and deploy accurate models in 3 lines of code.


```python
from autogluon.tabular import TabularPredictor

predictor = TabularPredictor(label="class").fit(train_data)
predictions = predictor.predict(test_data)
```

### Model Logging Made Easy: MLflow vs. Pickle


Here is why using MLflow to log model is superior to using pickle to save model:

1. Managing Library Versions:
- Problem: Different models may require different versions of the same library, which can lead to conflicts. Manually tracking and setting up the correct environment for each model is time-consuming and error-prone.
- Solution: By automatically logging dependencies, MLflow ensures that anyone can recreate the exact environment needed to run the model.

2. Documenting Inputs and Outputs: 
- Problem: Often, the expected inputs and outputs of a model are not well-documented, making it difficult for others to use the model correctly.
- Solution: By defining a clear schema for inputs and outputs, MLflow ensures that anyone using the model knows exactly what data to provide and what to expect in return.

To demonstrate the advantages of MLflow, letâ€™s implement a simple logistic regression model and log it.

```{python}
import mlflow
from mlflow.models import infer_signature
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

with mlflow.start_run():
    X = np.array([-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 1]).reshape(-1, 1)
    y = np.array([0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0])
    lr = LogisticRegression()
    lr.fit(X, y)
    signature = infer_signature(X, lr.predict(X))

    model_info = mlflow.sklearn.log_model(
        sk_model=lr, artifact_path="model", signature=signature
    )

    print(f"Saving data to {model_info.model_uri}")
```

The output indicates where the model has been saved. To use the logged model later, you can load it with the `model_uri`:

```{python}
import mlflow
import numpy as np

model_uri = "runs:/1e20d72afccf450faa3b8a9806a97e83/model"
sklearn_pyfunc = mlflow.pyfunc.load_model(model_uri=model_uri)

data = np.array([-4, 1, 0, 10, -2, 1]).reshape(-1, 1)

predictions = sklearn_pyfunc.predict(data)
```

Let's inspect the artifacts saved with the model:

```{python}
# %cd mlruns/0/1e20d72afccf450faa3b8a9806a97e83/artifacts/model
# %ls
```

The `MLmodel` file provides essential information about the model, including dependencies and input/output specifications:

```{python}
# %cat MLmodel
```

The `conda.yaml` and `python_env.yaml` files outline the environment dependencies, ensuring that the model runs in a consistent setup:

```{python}
# %cat conda.yaml
```

```{python}
# %cat python_env.yaml

```

```{python}
# %cat requirements.txt
```

### Simplifying ML Model Integration with FastAPI

```{python tags=c("hide-cell")}
# !pip3 install joblib "fastapi[standard]"
```

<!-- #region -->
Imagine this scenario: You have just built a machine learning (ML) model with great performance, and you want to share this model with your team members so that they can develop a web application on top of your model.

One way to share the model with your team members is to save the model to a file (e.g., using pickle, joblib, or framework-specific methods) and share the file directly


```python
import joblib

model = ...

# Save model
joblib.dump(model, "model.joblib")

# Load model
model = joblib.load(model)
```

However, this approach requires the same environment and dependencies, and it can pose potential security risks.

<!-- #endregion -->

An alternative is creating an API for your ML model. APIs define how software components interact, allowing:

1. Access from various programming languages and platforms
2. Easier integration for developers unfamiliar with ML or Python
3. Versatile use across different applications (web, mobile, etc.)

This approach simplifies model sharing and usage, making it more accessible for diverse development needs.

Let's learn how to create an ML API with FastAPI, a modern and fast web framework for building APIs with Python. 

Before we begin constructing an API for a machine learning model, let's first develop a basic model that our API will use. In this example, we'll create a model that predicts the median house price in California.

```{python}
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
import joblib

# Load dataset
X, y = fetch_california_housing(as_frame=True, return_X_y=True)

# Split dataset into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
)

# Initialize and train the logistic regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict and evaluate the model
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Mean squared error: {mse:.2f}")

# Save model
joblib.dump(model, "lr.joblib")
```

Once we have our model, we can create an API for it using FastAPI. We'll define a POST endpoint for making predictions and use the model to make predictions.

Here's an example of how to create an API for a machine learning model using FastAPI:

```{python}
# %%writefile ml_app.py
from fastapi import FastAPI
import joblib
import pandas as pd 

# Create a FastAPI application instance
app = FastAPI()

# Load the pre-trained machine learning model
model = joblib.load("lr.joblib")

# Define a POST endpoint for making predictions
@app.post("/predict/")
def predict(data: list[float]):
    # Define the column names for the input features
    columns = [
        "MedInc",
        "HouseAge",
        "AveRooms",
        "AveBedrms",
        "Population",
        "AveOccup",
        "Latitude",
        "Longitude",
    ]
    
    # Create a pandas DataFrame from the input data
    features = pd.DataFrame([data], columns=columns)
    
    # Use the model to make a prediction
    prediction = model.predict(features)[0]
    
    # Return the prediction as a JSON object, rounding to 2 decimal places
    return {"price": round(prediction, 2)}
```

To run your FastAPI app for development, use the `fastapi dev` command:
```bash
$ fastapi dev ml_app.py
``` 

```{python tags=c("remove-cell")}
# !fastapi dev ml_app.py
```

This will start the development server and open the API documentation in your default browser.

You can now use the API to make predictions by sending a POST request to the `/predict/` endpoint with the input data. For example:


Running this cURL command on your terminal:
```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict/' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '[
  1.68, 25, 4, 2, 1400, 3, 36.06, -119.01
]'
```
This will return the predicted price as a JSON object, rounded to 2 decimal places:
```python
{"price":1.51}
```


### imodels: Simplifying Machine Learning with Interpretable Models

```{python editable=TRUE, slideshow={'slide_type': ''}, tags=c("hide-cell")}
# !pip install imodels
```

Interpreting decisions made by complex modern machine learning models can be challenging.

imodels, a Python package, replaces black-box models (e.g. random forests) with simpler and interpretable alternatives (e.g. rule lists) without losing accuracy.

imodels works like scikit-learn models, making it easy to integrate into existing workflows.

Here's an example of fitting an interpretable decision tree to predict juvenile delinquency:

```{python}
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from imodels import get_clean_dataset, HSTreeClassifierCV 

# Prepare data
X, y, feature_names = get_clean_dataset('juvenile')
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, random_state=42)

# Initialize a tree model and specify only 4 leaf nodes
model = HSTreeClassifierCV(max_leaf_nodes=4)  
model.fit(X_train, y_train, feature_names=feature_names)  

# Make predictions
preds = model.predict(X_test) 

# Print the model
print(model)
```

This tree structure clearly shows how predictions are made based on feature values, providing transparency into the model's decision-making process. The hierarchical shrinkage technique also improves predictive performance compared to standard decision trees.

### How to Build a Recommendation Engine Using Surprise in Python

```{python editable=TRUE, slideshow={'slide_type': ''}, tags=c("hide-cell")}
# !pip install scikit-surprise
```

Building reliable recommendation systems from scratch requires complex algorithms and data handling, which results in spending significant time implementing common algorithms like SVD or handling cross-validation procedures.

```python
# Without a dedicated library, you'd need to implement basic collaborative filtering:
import numpy as np

def calculate_similarity(ratings_matrix):
    # Complex similarity calculations
    pass

def predict_rating(user_id, item_id, ratings, similarities):
    # Complex prediction logic
    pass

# Handle cross-validation manually
def cross_validate(ratings_data, n_folds):
    # Manual implementation of CV
    pass
```


Surprise helps you build and evaluate recommendation systems with just a few lines of code. You can use built-in algorithms, handle datasets easily, and evaluate models using cross-validation.

```{python}
import pandas as pd

from surprise import Dataset, SVD, Reader
from surprise.model_selection import cross_validate


# Creation of the dataframe. Column names are irrelevant.
ratings_dict = {
    "itemID": [1, 1, 1, 2, 2],
    "userID": [9, 32, 2, 45, 4],
    "rating": [3, 2, 4, 3, 1],
}
df = pd.DataFrame(ratings_dict)
 
# A reader is still needed but only the rating_scale param is required.
reader = Reader(rating_scale=(1, 5))

# The columns must correspond to user id, item id and ratings (in that order).
data = Dataset.load_from_df(df[["userID", "itemID", "rating"]], reader)

algo = SVD()

# Run 2-fold cross-validation and print results.
result = cross_validate(algo, data, cv=2, measures=['RMSE', 'MAE'], verbose=True)
```

Compute the rating prediction for given user and item.

```{python}
item_id = 302
user_id = 196

pred = algo.predict(user_id, item_id, verbose=True)
```

Surprise also provides a variety of basic algorithms, k-NN inspired algorithms, and matrix factorization-based algorithms. View all available algorithms [here](https://surprise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/prediction_algorithms_package.html).

### PyOD: Simplifying Outlier Detection in Python

```{python editable=TRUE, slideshow={'slide_type': ''}, tags=c("hide-cell")}
# !pip install pyod
```

Detecting anomalies or outliers in datasets is often challenging and time-consuming, requiring complex statistical calculations and multiple algorithm implementations. This results in data scientists writing redundant code or potentially missing important anomalies by using overly simplistic approaches.

Without specialized tools, detecting outliers often looks like this:




```{python}
import numpy as np

def detect_outliers(data):
    # Using simple statistical method (z-score)
    mean = np.mean(data)
    std = np.std(data)

    print(f"{mean=:.3f}")
    print(f"{std=:.3f}")
    
    z_scores = [(x - mean) / std for x in data]
    
    # Consider points beyond 3 standard deviations as outliers
    outliers = [x for x, z in zip(data, z_scores) if abs(z) > 3]
    
    return outliers

data = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 1000, 2, 3]
outliers = detect_outliers(data)
print(f"{outliers=}")
```

In this example, even though 1000 is apear to be an outlier in the `data` list, it is not in the `outliers` list. This is because the standard deviation is heavily influenced by the extreme value (1000).

With PyOD, you can easily implement various state-of-the-art outlier detection algorithms, combine multiple methods, and handle multivariate data. The library provides a consistent API across different algorithms and includes both traditional statistical methods and modern deep learning approaches.

Import models:


```{python}
from pyod.models.knn import KNN
from pyod.utils.data import generate_data
from pyod.utils.data import evaluate_print
from pyod.utils.example import visualize
```

Generate sample data:

```{python}
contamination = 0.1  # percentage of outliers
n_train = 200  # number of training points
n_test = 100  # number of testing points

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = generate_data(
    n_train=n_train, n_test=n_test, contamination=contamination)
```

Initialize a `pyod.models.knn.KNN` detector, fit the model, and make the prediction:

```{python}
# train kNN detector
clf = KNN()
clf.fit(X_train)

# get the prediction labels and outlier scores of the training data
y_train_pred = clf.labels_  # binary labels (0: inliers, 1: outliers)
y_train_scores = clf.decision_scores_  # raw outlier scores

# get the prediction on the test data
y_test_pred = clf.predict(X_test)  # outlier labels (0 or 1)
y_test_scores = clf.decision_function(X_test)  # outlier scores
```

Evaluate the prediction using ROC and Precision @ Rank n:

```{python}
clf_name = 'KNN'
print("\nOn Training Data:")
evaluate_print(clf_name, y_train, y_train_scores)
print("\nOn Test Data:")
evaluate_print(clf_name, y_test, y_test_scores)
```

Generate the visualizations by visualize function included in all examples:

```{python}
visualize(clf_name, X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test, y_train_pred,
          y_test_pred, show_figure=True, save_figure=False)
```

```{python}
visualize(clf_name, X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test, y_train_pred,
          y_test_pred, show_figure=True, save_figure=False)
```
