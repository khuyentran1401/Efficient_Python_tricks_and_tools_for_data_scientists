## Feature Extraction


### distfit: Find The Best Theoretical Distribution For Your Data

```{python tags=c("hide-cell")}
# !pip install distfit
```

If you're looking to identify the best theoretical distribution for your data in Python, try distfit. It allows you to fit and compare multiple distributions, identifying the best match for your dataset.

```{python}
import numpy as np
from distfit import distfit

X = np.random.normal(0, 3, 1000)

# Initialize model
dist = distfit()

# Find best theoretical distribution for empirical data X
distribution = dist.fit_transform(X)
dist.plot()
```

Beyond finding the optimal distribution, `distfit` can also help identify outliers based on deviation from the fitted distribution.

### Geopy: Extract Location Based on Python String

```{python tags=c("hide-cell")}
# !pip install geopy
```

`Geopy` simplifies the process of extracting geospatial information from location strings. With just a few lines of code, you can obtain the coordinates of addresses globally.

```{python}
from geopy.geocoders import Nominatim

geolocator = Nominatim(user_agent="find_location")
location = geolocator.geocode("30 North Circle Drive")
```

To get detailed information about the location:

```{python}
location.address
```

You can also extract latitude and longitude:

```{python}
location.latitude, location.longitude
```

### fastaiâ€™s cont_cat_split: Separate Continuous and Categorical Variables

```{python tags=c("hide-cell")}
# !pip install fastai
```

Fastai's `cont_cat_split` method helps you automatically separate continuous and categorical columns in a DataFrame based on their cardinality.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
from fastai.tabular.core import cont_cat_split

df = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "col1": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
        "col2": ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"],
        "col3": [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0],
    }
)

cont_names, cat_names = cont_cat_split(df)
print("Continuous columns:", cont_names)
print("Categorical columns:", cat_names)
```

```{python}
cont_names, cat_names = cont_cat_split(df, max_card=3)
print("Continuous columns:", cont_names)
print("Categorical columns:", cat_names)
```

### Patsy: Build Features with Arbitrary Python Code

```{python tags=c("hide-cell")}
# !pip install patsy
```

Patsy lets you quickly create features for your model using an intuitive syntax, ideal for experimentation.

```{python}
from sklearn.datasets import load_wine
import pandas as pd 
```

```{python}
df = load_wine(as_frame=True)
data = pd.concat([df['data'], df['target']], axis=1)
data.head(10)
```

```{python}
from patsy import dmatrices

y, X = dmatrices('target ~ alcohol + flavanoids + proline', data=data)
```

```{python}
X
```

These features can be directly used with machine learning models:

```{python}
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

model = LinearRegression().fit(X, y)
```

### yarl: Create and Extract Elements from a URL Using Python

```{python tags=c("hide-cell")}
# !pip install yarl
```

`yarl` makes URL parsing and creation easy. You can extract elements like host, path, and query from a URL or construct new URLs.

```{python}
from yarl import URL 

url = URL('https://github.com/search?q=data+science')
url 
```

```{python}
print(url.host) 
```

```{python}
print(url.path) 
```

```{python}
print(url.query_string) 
```

You can also build new URLs:

```{python}
# Create a URL

url = URL.build(
    scheme="https",
    host="github.com",
    path="/search",
    query={"p": 2, "q": "data science"},
)

print(url)
```

```{python}
# Replace the query

print(url.with_query({"q": "python"}))
```

```{python}
# Replace the path

new_path = url.with_path("khuyentran1401/Data-science")
print(new_path)
```

```{python}
# Update the fragment

print(new_path.with_fragment("contents"))
```

### Pigeon: Quickly Annotate Your Data on Jupyter Notebook

```{python tags=c("hide-cell")}
# !pip install pigeon-jupyter
```

For fast data annotation within Jupyter Notebooks, use `Pigeon`. This tool allows you to label data interactively by selecting from predefined options.

```{python}
from pigeon import annotate


annotations = annotate(
    ["The service is terrible", "I will definitely come here again"],
    options=["positive", "negative"],
)
```

```{python}
annotations
```

After labeling all your data, you can get the examples along with their labels by calling `annotations`.

### probablepeople: Parse Unstructured Names Into Structured Components

```{python tags=c("hide-cell")}
# !pip install probablepeople  
```

`probablepeople` helps you parse unstructured names into structured components like first names, surnames, and company names.

```{python}
import probablepeople as pp

pp.parse("Mr. Owen Harris II")
```

```{python}
pp.parse("Kate & John Cumings")
```

```{python}
pp.parse("Prefect Technologies, Inc")
```

### Supercharge PDF Text Extraction in Python with pypdf

```{python tags=c("hide-cell")}
# !pip install -U pypdf
```

PDF text is designed for beautiful on-screen display rather than optimized structured data extraction, making text extraction from PDFs challenging. 

Besides simple text extraction, pypdf also knows about fonts, encodings, and typical character distance, which enhances the accuracy of text extraction from PDFs.

```{python}
from pypdf import PdfReader

reader = PdfReader("example.pdf")
page = reader.pages[0]
text = page.extract_text()
```
