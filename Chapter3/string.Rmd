## String


![](../img/string.png)


### Control the Number of Printed Decimals with f-Strings


If you want to limit the number of decimals being printed, use the f-string as shown below. 

```{python}
num = 2.3123
print(f'{num:.1f}') # Limit to 1 decimal
print(f'{num:.2f}') # Limit to 2 decimals
```

### Format Dates in Python f-Strings


When printing a Python string, f-strings allow you to format datetime easily with a curly bracket and its formats.

Find all formats [here](https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-behavior).

```{python}
from datetime import datetime

date = datetime(2022, 1, 1, 15, 30, 45)
print(f'You need to be here at'
f' {date:%I:%M %p} on {date:%A}')
```

### Pad a String With Zero Using f-String


To display a number as a two-digit with leading zeros if needed, use f'{num:02}'.

```{python}
for hour in range(8, 12):
    print(f'It is {hour:02} AM! Wake up!')
```

### Enhance Number Readability with f-Strings and Comma Formatting 


To increase the readability of a number with a large number of digits, you can use f-strings to display an integer with comma formatting for thousands.

```{python}
num = 100**4
print(num)
print(f"{num:,}")
```

### Use Calculations in Python f-String


If you want to do calculations inside a Python string, use f-string.

```{python}
apple = 3
banana = 2
print(f'The total price is {apple + banana}.')
```

### Debug Your Python Code with an Equal Sign in an f-String


It is common to use `f"var={var}"` to see which values are being printed.

```{python}
from itertools import permutations

nums = [1, 2, 3]

for i, j in permutations(nums, 2):
    print(f"i={i}, j={j}")
```

In Python 3.8 and above, you can get the same outputs using `f"{var=}"`.

```{python}
for i, j in permutations(nums, 2):
    print(f"{i=}, {j=}")
```

```{python}
for i in range(3):
    print(f"{i=}")

```

### String find: Find The Index of a Substring in a Python String


If you want to find the index of a substring in a string, use `find()` method. This method will return the index of the first occurrence of the substring if found and return `-1` otherwise.

```{python}
sentence = "Today is Saturday"

# Find the index of first occurrence of the substring
sentence.find("day")
```

```{python}
sentence.find("nice")
# No substring is found
```

You can also provide the starting and stopping position of the search:

```{python}
# Start searching for the substring at index 3
sentence.find("day", 3)
```

### re.sub: Replace One String with Another String Using Regular Expression	


If you want to either replace one string with another string or to change the order of characters in a string, use `re.sub`.

`re.sub` allows you to use a regular expression to specify the pattern of the string you want to swap.

In the code below, I replace `3/7/2021` with `Sunday` and replace `3/7/2021` with `2021/3/7`.

```{python}
import re

text = "Today is 3/7/2021"
match_pattern = r"(\d+)/(\d+)/(\d+)"

re.sub(match_pattern, "Sunday", text)
```

```{python}
re.sub(match_pattern, r"\3-\1-\2", text)
```

### Split a String by Multiple Characters


Using `str.split` only allows you to split a string by one character.

```{python}
sent = "Today-is a nice_day"

sent.split('-')
```

If you want to split a string by multiple characters, use `re.split()`. re uses regrex to split the string.

```{python}
import re

# split by space, -, or _
re.split(" |-|_", sent)

```

### Multiline Strings 


If your Python string gets very long, you can break it up using parentheses or a backslash.

```{python}
text = (
    "This is a very "
    "long sentence "
    "that is made up."
)

text
```

```{python}
text = "This is a very "\
    "long sentence "\
    "that is made up."

text
```

### difflib.SequenceMatcher: Detect The “Almost Similar” Articles


When analyzing articles, different articles can be almost similar but not 100% identical, maybe because of the grammar, or because of the change in two or three words (such as cross-posting). How can we detect the “almost similar” articles and drop one of them? That is when `difflib.SequenceMatcher` comes in handy. 

```{python}
from difflib import SequenceMatcher

text1 = 'I am Khuyen'
text2 = 'I am Khuen'
print(SequenceMatcher(a=text1, b=text2).ratio())
```

### difflib.get_close_matches:  Get a List of the Best Matches for a Certain Word


If you want to get a list of the best matches for a certain word, use `difflib.get_close_matches`.  

```{python}
from difflib import get_close_matches

tools = ['pencil', 'pen', 'erasor', 'ink']
get_close_matches('pencel', tools)
```

To get closer matches, increase the value of the argument `cutoff` (default 0.6). 

```{python}
get_close_matches('pencel', tools, cutoff=0.8)
```
