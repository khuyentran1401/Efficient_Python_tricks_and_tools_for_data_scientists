## Data Classes


### Data Classes vs Normal Classes


If you want to use classes to store data, use the dataclass module. This module is available in Python 3.7+.


With dataclass, you can create a class with attributes, type hints, and a nice representation of the data in a few lines of code. To use dataclass, simply add the `@dataclass` decorator on top of a class.

```{python}
from dataclasses import dataclass


@dataclass
class DataClassDog:
    color: str
    age: int
```

```{python}
DataClassDog(color="black", age=9)
```

Without dataclass, you need to use `__init__` to assign values to appropriate variables and use `__repr__` to create a nice presentation of the data, which can be very cumbersome.

```{python}
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, color, age):
        self.color = color
        self.age = age

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Dog(color={self.color} age={self.age})"
```

```{python}
Dog(color="black", age=9)
```

### frozen=True: Make Your Data Classes Read-Only


If you don't want anybody to adjust the attributes of a class, use `@dataclass(frozen=True)`.

```{python}
from dataclasses import dataclass


@dataclass(frozen=True)
class DataClassDog:
    color: str
    age: int
```

Now changing the attribute `color` of  the `DataClassDog`'s instance will throw an error.

```{python}
pepper = DataClassDog(color="black", age=9)
pepper.color = "golden"
```

### Compare Between Two Data Classes


Normally, you need to implement the `__eq__` method so that you can compare between two classes.

```{python}
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, type, age):
        self.type = type
        self.age = age

    def __eq__(self, other):
        return self.type == other.type and self.age == other.age


pepper = Dog(type="Dachshund", age=7)
bim = Dog(type="Dachshund", age=7)
pepper == bim
```

dataclasses automatically implements the `__eq__` method for you. With dataclasses, you can compare between 2 classes by only specifying their attributes.

```{python}
from dataclasses import dataclass


@dataclass
class DataClassDog:
    type: str
    age: int
```

```{python}
pepper = DataClassDog(type="Dachshund", age=7)
bim = DataClassDog(type="Dachshund", age=7)
pepper == bim
```

### Post-init: Add Init Method to a Data Class


With a data class, you don't need an `__init__` method to assign values to its attributes. However, sometimes you might want to use an `___init__` method to initialize certain attributes. That is when data class's `__post_init__` comes in handy.


In the code below, I use `__post_init__` to initialize the attribute `info` using the attributes `names` and `ages`.

```{python}
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import List


@dataclass
class Dog:
    names: str
    age: int


@dataclass
class Dogs:
    names: List[str]
    ages: List[int]

    def __post_init__(self):
        self.info = [Dog(name, age) for name, age in zip(self.names, self.ages)]
```

```{python}
names = ["Bim", "Pepper"]
ages = [5, 6]
dogs = Dogs(names, ages)
dogs.info
```

```{python}
from dataclasses import dataclass


@dataclass
class Dog:
    names: str
    age: int


dog = Dog(names="Bim", age="ten")
if not isinstance(dog.age, int):
    raise ValueError("Dog's age must be an integer.")
```

### Python Best Practices: Using default_factory for Mutable Defaults


When defining classes in Python, using mutable default values for instance variables can lead to unexpected behavior.


For example, if you use a list as a default value in a class's `__init__` method, all instances of the class will share the same list object:

```{python}
class Book:
    def __init__(self, title, authors=[]):
        self.title = title
        self.authors = authors


book1 = Book("Book 1")
book1.authors.append("Author 1")

book2 = Book("Book 2")
print(book2.authors)
```

In this example, `book1` and `book2` share the same list object, which is why modifying the list in `book1` affects `book2`.

To avoid this issue, you can use the `default_factory` parameter in dataclasses, which creates a new object for each instance:

```{python}
from dataclasses import dataclass, field


@dataclass
class Book:
    title: str
    authors: list = field(default_factory=list)


book1 = Book("Book 1")
book1.authors.append("Author 1")

book2 = Book("Book 2")
print(book2.authors)
```

Now, each instance has its own separate list object, and modifying one instance's list does not affect others.

### Simplify Nested Structures with Python Data Classes


Working with nested structures typically requires manual management of nested dictionaries or objects. This can lead to errors and increase code complexity.

```{python}
# Example of managing nested structures manually
person_data = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "address": {"street": "123 Maple St", "city": "Springfield", "zip": "12345"},
    "contacts": {"email": "alice@example.com", "phone": "555-1234"},
}

# Accessing nested data
street = person_data["address"]["street"]
email = person_data["contacts"]["email"]

print(f"Street: {street}, Email: {email}")
```

The `dataclasses` module in Python simplifies the creation and handling of nested structures by providing a clean, declarative syntax.

Define nested data classes to represent more complex hierarchical structures:

```{python}
from dataclasses import dataclass


# Define nested data classes
@dataclass
class Address:
    street: str
    city: str
    zip: str


@dataclass
class Contacts:
    email: str
    phone: str


@dataclass
class Person:
    name: str
    address: Address
    contacts: Contacts


# Create and use nested data classes
person = Person(
    name="Alice",
    address=Address(street="123 Maple St", city="Springfield", zip="12345"),
    contacts=Contacts(email="alice@example.com", phone="555-1234"),
)

print(f"Street: {person.address.street}, Email: {person.contacts.email}")
```

In the code above:

- `dataclass` is used to define simple, immutable, and type-safe structures.
- `Address`, `Contacts`, and `Person` are nested classes representing various levels of the hierarchy.
- Accessing nested data like `person.address.street` is more intuitive and less error-prone compared to using dictionaries.


The output displays the street and email address of the person. Using nested data classes, each level of the hierarchy is type-safe and easy to access.
